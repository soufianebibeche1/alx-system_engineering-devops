# API Advanced Project

## Description
This project is designed to help you practice working with APIs, specifically focusing on the Reddit API. You will learn how to read API documentation, make API calls, handle pagination, parse JSON responses, and perform recursive API calls. Additionally, you will learn how to sort dictionary data in Python.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Libraries imported in Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the PEP 8 style
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using wc
- All modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- Use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand how to read API documentation to find relevant endpoints
- Use APIs with pagination to retrieve large datasets
- Parse JSON responses from APIs
- Implement recursive API calls for handling nested data structures
- Sort dictionary data by value in Python
